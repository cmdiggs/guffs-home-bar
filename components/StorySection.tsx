        Guffs started with a moment in a Baltimore airport. My wife and I were waiting on a flight when we noticed an older couple arguing back and forth, matching suitcases at their feet, a lifetime together stitched into every exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        We like to make up stories about people we see, and at one point I leaned over and said, &ldquo;That man gives no more guffs.&rdquo; We laughed, and the phrase stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the plane I said, &ldquo;If we ever have a bar, we should call it Guffs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>Years later, when we finally had the space, the name was already waiting.</p>
      <p>
        Guffs became a place to gather, to celebrate wins, sit with losses, watch games, or simply show up and feel at home.
      </p>
      <p>Some bottles are marked to remember who was here and why it mattered.</p>
      <p>Guffs is not about bourbon. It is about belonging.</p>
