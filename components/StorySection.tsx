      <p>Guffs did not start as a bar.</p>
      <p>It started in an airport.</p>
      <p>
        A few years ago, while sitting in a Baltimore terminal waiting on a flight, we noticed an older couple nearby. They had to be in their seventies, maybe eighties. Matching suitcases. Initials stitched on. A lifetime together, quietly on display.
      </p>
      <p>
        They fussed the entire time.<br />
        She would say something. He would answer back.<br />
        He would say something. She would return the favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        My wife and I love making up stories about people we see. Who they are. How long they have been together. What they might be arguing about. Somewhere in that moment, I leaned over and said, &ldquo;That man gives no more guffs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        We laughed, and then we kept going.<br />
        &ldquo;He is guffed out.&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;He gives no guffs.&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;He is just guffed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>By the time we boarded the plane, it stuck.</p>
      <p>
        I turned to her and said, &ldquo;If we ever have a bar, we should call it Guffs, for no other reason than this moment right here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>Years later, when we finally had the space to build a bar, the name was already waiting.</p>
      <p>
        Guffs became a place built for being present. A place to watch games, sit quietly, celebrate good things, grieve hard losses, or simply show up and not feel alone. Some of the bottles are tied to special moments and people. On the back of them are small library checkout cards where names and dates are written, marking what was worth celebrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a place where adults and children are welcome. A place where we have cheered loudly and sat in silence together. A place meant to feel familiar.
      </p>
      <p>Guffs is not really about bourbon.</p>
      <p>It is about belonging.</p>
