Proxima Nova font files go here.

Add these files (from your font license or Adobe Fonts export):
  - ProximaNova-Regular.woff2   (weight 400)
  - ProximaNova-Semibold.woff2  (weight 600)
  - ProximaNova-Bold.woff2      (weight 700)

If you only have one file, name it ProximaNova-Regular.woff2 and the app will use it for all weights (with browser synthesis for bold). The site will still work without these files but will fall back to system fonts until they are added.
